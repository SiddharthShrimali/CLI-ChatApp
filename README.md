# ChatApp

• Developed a scalable TCP-based, client-sever application supporting real-time bidirectional chat via a CLI
interface.

• Implemented client-server file transfer, successfully transferring files up to 50 MB over TCP.

• Measured end-to-end transfer performance of∼7 MB/s using TCP sockets, ensuring reliable delivery alongside
chat messages.

• Designed a mode-based CLI workflow, allowing users to switch between chat and file transfer.
